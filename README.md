I wanted to highlight some interesting videos on YouTube. 
And I'd been playing around with ASCII art. So I combined the two. 

[YouTubeWatchlistVHSHORROR.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaiiintt/youtubewatchlist.txt/main/YouTubeWatchlistVHSHORROR.txt) - a collection of VHS video nasties from my formative years.

I don't know if I'll ever make more than one.
