I wanted to highlight some interesting videos on YouTube. 
And I'd been playing around with ASCII art. 
So I thought it might be fun to comine the two. 
I don't know if I'll ever make more than one, but if I do I'll add it to this list:

- [YouTubeWatchlistVHSHORROR.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaiiintt/youtubewatchlist.txt/main/YouTubeWatchlistVHSHORROR.txt)

**CREDIT:**
Most of the video links were sourced from these two amazing YouTube playlists where you'll find hundreds more lesser known gems:
- [Bob's super awesome B-movie playlist!!!](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAx7GszKPjfhcCAwDVnQH7VLXyZsl5Bog&si=MjTgHb1nRZuJ35Xi)
- [BIG FAT CULT - Horror, Cult, B Movies, Video Nasties & More!](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFjziTVgklgq8HULzkZbtG2lFjY5E-qS&si=zIk0RziB5uQxmiLu)

I used Monodraw for the design.

And https://ascii-generator.site to create the ASCII art
