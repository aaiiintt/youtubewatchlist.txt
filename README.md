Most of the video links were sourced from these two amazing YouTube playlists 
- [Bob's super awesome B-movie playlist!!!](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAx7GszKPjfhcCAwDVnQH7VLXyZsl5Bog&si=MjTgHb1nRZuJ35Xi)

Go explore, you'll find hundreds of gems.

I used Monodraw (https://monodraw.helftone.com) to lay out the text file.

And to create the ASCII art I used the wonderful https://ascii-generator.site - [Github](https://github.com/hermanTenuki/ASCII-Generator.site) - 
Thank you :-)
